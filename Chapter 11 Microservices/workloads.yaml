#1. ClusterIP: 
 #  - ClusterIP is the default service type in Kubernetes. 
  # - It exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP address. 
  # - The service is only accessible within the cluster. 
  #- It allows other pods within the cluster to access the service using the ClusterIP and port number. 
 
#2. NodePort: 
 #  - NodePort is a service type that exposes the service on a static port on each worker node in the cluster. 
  # - It allows external traffic to reach the service by accessing the worker nodes' IP addresses on that specific port. 
  # - The service is accessible both within the cluster and externally. 
  # - It is useful when you need to access the service from outside the cluster, such as from your local machine or other extern
